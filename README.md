## An open-source encrypted replacement for Google Drive and One Drive

Google Drive and OneDrive are expensive.
It is difficult to create local backups of your storage.
Your data is readable by the organizations that store it.
Plaintext editors are not provided.
There is no way to self-host your data.
They have poor (slow, often incomplete) mobile interfaces.

The Rift Drive allows you to use a cross-platform web interface to access encrypted documents, hosted in the cloud or local servers.
Web editors support simultaneous editing with realtime sync between devices.
